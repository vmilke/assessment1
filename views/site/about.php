        <b>	Today, ARU is an innovative global university. 39,400 students from 177 countries gain qualifications with us in four continents.  
			Each year, we also help some 2,000 businesses to grow quicker and partner with organisations to deliver a spectrum of educational and commercial projects.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Why choose ARU? There are many reasons. We’re academically ambitious for ourselves and our students. We’re purposeful, challenging and curious about our world. 
		We’re a place where collaboration, research and scholarly activity informs everything we do. While our head is full of ambition, our feet are planted in the world around us. 
		We pride ourselves on being as enterprising as we are innovative and nurture those qualities in our students. That, and our sheer can-do attitude, set us apart. 
		We find that enthusiasm is infectious, letting the results speak for themselves.
		An Anglia Ruskin graduate has a nine out of ten chance of getting a job, a better chance than most other graduates of securing a permanent job, and is likely to beat 
		the average graduate salary – all within six months of leaving us.
